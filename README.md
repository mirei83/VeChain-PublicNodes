# Public VeChain Thor nodes

VeBlocks provides access to all VeChain Thor networks via publicly accessible HTTP/HTTPS connections. This is a community project to support all developers and allow them everywhere-access to the blockchain, without the need to have a full node with them.
I will not collect or chance any data coming/going to the nodes. There are just some logs kept for maintenance and performance evaluation. These logs will be deleted after 14 days. 

## Getting Started

All node are maintained by VeBlocks and always kept compatible with the networks. The only limitation is 3000 open connections and a maximum of 100 requests per 10 seconds against /blocks/best (bercause there are always some idiots) per IP address. The nodes are accessible via HTTP/HTTPS and P2P, making them also available as bootnode.


## Using the nodes


### VeChain mainnet node
```
Cloudflare, loadbalanced:
https://mainnet.veblocks.net

```

### VeChain testnet node
```
Cloudflare, loadbalanced:
https://testnet.veblocks.net 


```


### Uptime and connectivity
This is a community project and the nodes will be up as much as possible but there may be short downtimes due to updates/upgrades or any other hard/software failure. VeBlocks is not responsible for your software. Consider these variables when using the nodes!
